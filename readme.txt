Auto-generate missing ALT text for WordPress image attachments with multiple generation modes, bulk operations, and developer hooks.

== Description ==

AutoAltify is a powerful WordPress plugin that automatically generates descriptive ALT text for images in your media library. Improve accessibility and SEO while saving time on manual ALT text entry.

= Features =

* **Automatic ALT Text Generation** - Generate ALT text from image titles, filenames, or combined with site name
* **Three Generation Modes** - Title Only, Title + Site Name, or Clean Filename
* **Bulk Operations** - Generate ALT text for your entire media library with one click
* **AJAX Batching** - Process images in batches to prevent timeouts
* **Media Library Integration** - View ALT status directly in media library
* **Logging** - Optional detailed logging for troubleshooting
* **Bulk Actions** - Process selected images from media library
* **Developer Hooks** - Extensive filters and actions for custom integration
* **Multi-language Ready** - Fully translatable

= Generation Modes =

**Title Only** - Uses the clean image title as ALT text

**Title + Site Name** - Combines the image title with your blog name

**Clean Filename** - Extracts readable text from filenames, removing common noise words (v1, v2, final, copy, img, image, etc.)

= Three Ways to Use =

1. **Enable Auto-generate** - Automatically generate ALT text when images are uploaded
2. **Bulk Run Tool** - Generate ALT text for entire media library from settings page
3. **Media Library Bulk Action** - Select specific images and generate ALT text

= Security & Performance =

* Secure nonce verification on all AJAX actions
* Proper capability checks for all admin functions
* Efficient batching prevents server timeouts
* Configurable batch sizes (5-200 images per batch)
* Works with large media libraries (1000+ images)

= Developer-Friendly =

* Modular class-based architecture
* Multiple action and filter hooks for customization
* Clean namespace implementation (AutoAltify\)
* Well-documented code with PHPDoc comments
* Easy to extend and integrate with other plugins

= Translations =

**autoaltify_generated_alt**

    add_filter( 'autoaltify_generated_alt', function( $alt, $attachment_id ) {
        return 'Image: ' . $alt;
    }, 10, 2 );

**autoaltify_clean_title**
Modify the cleaned title before final ALT text.

**autoaltify_clean_filename**

== FAQ ==

= Will this overwrite existing ALT text? =

No. AutoAltify only generates ALT text for images that don't already have it.

= Can I customize the ALT text? =

Yes! Use the provided filters (autoaltify_generated_alt, autoaltify_clean_title, autoaltify_clean_filename) to customize generation.

= What about performance with large media libraries? =

AJAX batching handles large libraries efficiently. The system processes configurable batches with delays to prevent timeouts.

= Where are logs stored? =

Logs are stored at wp-content/uploads/autoaltify-logs/autoaltify.log when logging is enabled.

= Which image types are supported? =

JPG/JPEG, PNG, GIF, WebP, AVIF, and SVG. All can be enabled/disabled in settings.

= Will this work with custom post types? =

Currently supports standard WordPress attachments. Use filters to extend for custom implementations.

= What happens on deactivation? =

Settings and logs are preserved. Simply reactivate to continue using.
